This repository is the total collection of what I learned in NPower Junior Data Analytics Program, Canada.

The /indian_startup_funding.csv/ datasheets and the /NP-6-A-P-Exercises on String Patterns, Sorting, Grouping, and Built-in Database Functions.pdf/  activity sheets required for the exercises on String Patterns, Sorting and Grouping Built-in database functions.
/NP-6-A-P-Exercises on String Patterns, Sorting, Grouping, and Built-in Database Functions.SQL/ is the solution for the excercise file.
